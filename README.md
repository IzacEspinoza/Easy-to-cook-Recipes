Simple HTML web-page, simply to practice HTML skills and building simple web-pages. 

## Starting off in just pure HTML, later implementing some CSS and maybe JS
First built in nothing but HTML, like I said, simply to practice and hone that skillset in structuring and formatting a webpage.  Later plan on using CSS to style it up and make it look like a much more legit and professional page that someone could actuallay see themselves using.  Then, maybe some JavaScript to add some cool things like an API where users can search for some recipes, and just use this site to give them an easy rundown of whatever they searched for.
