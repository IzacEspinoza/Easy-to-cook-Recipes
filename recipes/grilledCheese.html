      <ol>
        <li>Heat up a pan to be hot enough to melt the butter</li>
        <li>
          While pan is heating up, place some cheese in between your two slices
          of bread
        </li>
        <li>
          With pan heated up nice and ready now, drop your scoops of butter into
          the pan, melting and spreading it around the pans surface
        </li>
        <li>
          With the butter melted good and spread nice around the pan, place your
          sandwich flat in there!
        </li>
        <li>
          Let the one side of the sandwich get nice and crispy brown(helps to
